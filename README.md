Local Linear Regression with Gaussian Process Regularization

This code is for regularizing local linear regression by modeling the parameters as a Gaussian Process, effectively smoothing them and in many cases reducing mean-square error of parameter estimates.

Optimization and model specification are both done in Stan.
